# Datasets for MS MARCO Web Search 

## Introduction

MS MARCO Web Search is a large-scale information-rich Web dataset, featuring millions of real clicked query-document labels. This dataset closely mimics real-world web document and
query distribution, provides rich information for various kinds of downstream tasks. It incorporates the largest open web document dataset, ClueWeb22, as our document corpus. 
ClueWeb22 includes about 10 billion high-quality web pages, sufficiently large to serve as representative web-scale data. It also contains rich information from the web pages, such as visual
representation rendered by web browsers, raw HTML structure, clean text, semantic annotations, language and topic tags labeled by industry document understanding systems, etc. MS MARCO Web
Search further contains 10 million unique queries from 93 languages with millions of relevant labeled query-document pairs collected from the search log of the Microsoft Bing search engine to serve
as the query set.

It offers a retrieval benchmark on 100 million document set with three web retrieval challenge tasks that demands innovations in both machine learning and information retrieval
system research domains: embedding model, embedding retrieval, and end-to-end retrieval challenges. The main goal of the leaderboard is to study what retrieval methods work best and what retrieval 
methods are cost-efficient when a large amount of data is available.

Moreover, MS MARCO Web Search also offers 5 times larger real click labels for the whole 10 billion document set. Researchers can use this dataset to verify whether methods that work on small data also work on large data.

## Tasks

There are three tasks: embedding model, embedding retrieval, and end-to-end retrieval rankings.

### Embedding Model Ranking Task

The first task focuses on embedding model ranking. The large-scale web data volume requires large embedding models to guarantee sufficient knowledge coverage. It requires balancing the following two goals: good model generalization ability
and efficient train/inference speed. Given a query, you are expected to rank documents from the full collection based on their relevance to the query. You can submit up to **100 documents** for this task. It models the embedding model quality. The metrics we evaluate include:
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): the average of the multiplicative inverse of the rank of the first correct result, which is widely used for evaluating the model quality.
- Recall: the average percentage of ground truth items (test query-document labels) recalled during the search.
- Throughput (QPS): All queries are provided at once, and we measure the wall clock time between the ingestion of the vectors and when all the results are output using all the threads in a machine. Then the throughput is calculated as the processed queries per second (QPS).
- Latency: we measure the 50, 90 and 99 percentile query latency at certain QPS.

|Baselines | MRR@10 | recall@1 | recall@5 | recall@10 | recall@20 | recall@100  | QPS | P50 latency | P90 latency | P99 latency |

### Embedding Retrieval Ranking Task

Embedding models need to co-work with the embedding retrieval system to serve a web scale dataset. The second task focuses on embedding retrieval algorithm/system performance and accuracy. We take the embedding vectors
generated by one of the baseline models as the ANN vector set. The goal of this challenge is to call for ANN algorithm innovations to minimize the accuracy gap between approximate search and
brute-force search while still preserving good system performance. In this task, we only evaluate ANN Recall (take the brute-force vector search results as the ground truth), Throughout and Latency.

|Baselines | ANN recall@1 | ANN recall@10 | ANN recall@100 | QPS | P50 latency | P90 latency | P99 latency  |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|[SPANN](https://github.com/microsoft/SPTAG) | 87.97% | 80.55% | 69.84% | 625 | 10.411 ms | 10.873 ms | 11.334 ms |

### End-to-end Retrieval Ranking Task

In the web scenario, the result quality and system performance of the end-to-end retrieval system are the most important metrics in comparing different solutions. This challenge task encourages any kind of solutions,
including an embedding model plus ANN system, inverted index solution, hybrid solution, neural indexer, and large language model, etc.

|Baselines | MRR@10 | recall@1 | recall@5 | recall@10 | recall@20 | recall@100  | QPS | P50 latency | P90 latency | P99 latency |
